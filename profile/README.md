## Hi To Negev Web Developers community  👋

The Negev Web Developers community is a group of web developers and enthusiasts in the Negev region of Israel. 
The community was founded around 2014 with the goal of bringing together web developers from the region to share knowledge, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects.
